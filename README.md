# Overview

This is a simple project for using React to practice connecting to API, sending HTTP requests, and handling the errors. I am taking a Udemy course from Max and I used his starting project to code along, so I can learn all these skills.

I sent GET request to the Star Wars API and both GET and POST requests to my Google Firebase project.
